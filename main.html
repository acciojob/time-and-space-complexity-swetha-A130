  <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the big O notation. It's an indication of the efficiency of an algorithm.</p>
  <p>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run. The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm to execute a program and produce output. <b>Space Complexity: O(n)</b></p>
